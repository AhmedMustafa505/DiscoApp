# DiscoApp

This is a React Native application developed using Expo, designed to help users track their expenses over different categories and time periods.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI installed on your computer.
